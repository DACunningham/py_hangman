# py_hangman
Key files for program to work:

Cunningham_Dexter_Hangman.py
WordGenerator.py
GameStatus.py
words.txt

The main function is in 'Cunningham_Dexter_Hangman.py', so it is this file that needs to be executed for the game to run.

I tried a TDD approach to developing this game so, the tests file is also included for reference:

hangman_test.py
